## Problem Statement

Traditional policing faces challenges with non-digital feedback methods, limiting transparency and inclusivity. Kavach addresses this by developing a Progressive Web App (PWA) for seamless police feedback.

## Approach

Our approach is centered on creating a user-centric platform that caters to policemen, the public, and administrators. Through a PWA, we aim to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the community, ensuring transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency.

## Key Features

1. **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Ensures cross-platform compatibility.
2. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Optimized for a diverse user base.
3. **Online Data Management:** Centralized storage for efficient access.
4. **Multilingual Support:** Accommodates diverse user groups.
5. **Chatbot Integration:** Assists users in providing feedback.
6. **Anonymous Feedback:** Fosters open communication.
7. **Social Media-Like Platform:** Enhances user engagement.
8. **Automatic Data Entry:** Reduces manual efforts.
9. **Cost-Effective Development:** Combines web and mobile development.
10. **Police GPS Tracker:** Ensures real-time location tracking.
11. **Face Recognition System:** Enhances security measures.
